# Why

I'm a Ruby(also Sinatra) newbie. I built this tool to help myself learning Ruby and Sinatra at the same time. Why choose RegEx? Cuz I'm really bad at regulate espression too. So the main reason of this project is to tech myself Ruby, Sinatra, Regulare espression ;).
I then realized the neeed of save the result back to Gist for reference later.
